# machine-learning
This repo consists of my work in understanding the machine-learning algorithms and concepts

Implementation and analysis of machine-learning algorithms from scratch...
- K nearest neighbor in both burte-force and LSH implementation.
- Logistic regression with vizualization on separating hyperplane and the missclassified points.
- Linear regression (by solving the optimization problem using Gradient Descent).
- RandomSearchCV with knn as the estimator.
- BoW and TF-IDF (featurizing text input). 
- Bootstrap aggregation (bagging).
- Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT).
- K-means implementation with visualization.
- Deep-learning's famous Backpropagation algorithm on the given computational graph.
- Writing the custom callbacks in Tensorflow.
- Perform proportional sampling.
- Computing confidence interval using bootstrapping.

Repo also includes...
- EDA on Haberman dataset.
- Effect of regularization in linear regression with visualization.
- How Logistic regression behaves on imbalanced dataset.
- What happens to the model with and without standardization.
- Implementation and analysis of various model evaluation metrics.
